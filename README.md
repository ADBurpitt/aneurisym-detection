RSNA Intracranial Aneurysm Detection

This repository contains code and experiments for the RSNA Intracranial Aneurysm Detection
 Kaggle competition.
The goal is to build ML models that can detect and localize brain aneurysms from multi-modal DICOM imaging (CTA, MRA, MRI), across institutions and protocols.

ðŸ§  Approach

2.5D Multiple Instance Learning (MIL):
Each DICOM series is split into overlapping bags of slices (K consecutive slices).
A ResNet backbone encodes each slice, and bag features are pooled to predict aneurysm presence across 14 target labels.

Multi-label Classification:

13 location-specific labels (e.g., MCA, ACA, ICA, Basilar Tip, etc.)

1 global target: Aneurysm Present (weighted Ã—13 in the competition metric).

Loss: BCEWithLogitsLoss with per-class pos_weight to handle severe class imbalance.

Evaluation Metric: Weighted AUC (Kaggle official metric).
Our helper computes 13Ã—1 + APÃ—13 â†’ averaged.
